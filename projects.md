### Cloud-based management of hardware compliance data for access point devices ([USPTO 12,238,565](https://patents.google.com/patent/US20230308928A1/))
A plurality of access point (AP) devices configured to provide a wireless network at a site within a 
geographic region and a management system (NMS) configured to manage the plurality of APs are described.
An AP device sends, to the NMS, a message including version information of hardware compliance data 
currently stored at the AP device. The NMS determines, based on the version information, whether the 
first version of the hardware compliance data stored at the AP device is in compliance with applicable
regulations of the geographic region. When the first version is not in compliance, the AP device receives, 
from the NMS, a second version of the hardware compliance data that is in compliance with the applicable 
regulations of the geographic region. The AP device enables operation of one or more hardware components 
of the AP device in accordance with the second version of the hardware compliance data.


### Orientation based transmission power ([USPTO 11,917,554](https://patents.google.com/patent/US20220295420A1/))
Disclosed are embodiments of a device that includes an orientation sensor. Based on the device's orientation,
a transmit power of the device is limited to ensure that transmission of the device do not exceed regulatory
requirements. The transmit power limit is based, in some embodiments, on a manufacturer or model of the device,
which indicates a position of one or more antennas relative to the device, and allows for a determination of
an amount of power transmitted above the horizon in a given orientation.


### Method for conveying AP error codes over BLE advertisements ([USPTO 10,862,742](https://patents.google.com/patent/US10862742B2/))
Methods and apparatus for automatically obtaining status from an isolated AP that cannot connect to the cloud.
The obtained status information is then used to automatically mitigate the issue and accelerate connecting the
isolated AP back to the cloud. The methods are well suited for use in a system with a variety of access points,
e.g., wireless and/or wired access points, which can be used to obtain access to the Internet or another network
such as "the cloud". Network management system has been configured to monitor the network and use preconfigured
data to determine a remedial action to be automatically taken when an AP loses connectivity with the cloud.
