  * scanning as well as advertising together, to allow functionality such as way-finding and asset tracking 
to run in conjunction
  * power control for transmission of the BLE Signal from the Access Point
* WiFi threat detection and mitigation for
  * Rogue access points and clients
  * HoneyPots
* Implemented mechanisms and new messaging schemes to reduce load on the cloud based micro-services while reporting information from the access points
* Research in passive analytics of BLE devices including decoding of standard as well as proprietary BLE advertisements
