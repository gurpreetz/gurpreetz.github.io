I was born and raised in a quiet corner of the sprawling metropolis that is Mumbai (formerly Bombay), India. 

I graduated with a Masters degree from the [Information Networking Institute](www.ini.cmu.edu) at 
[Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/) in May 2008. My master's thesis was on network 
attributes and location awareness in Sensor Networks. I worked with [Prof Raj Rajkumar](https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~raj/).

I currently lead embedded BLE development at [Mist Systems](https://www.mist.com/) as a Member of the Technical Staff.  
At Mist, I develop Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacon solutions to help improve indoor location using a patented 
virtual BLE (vBLE) technology. I've worked on interleaving iBeacon, Eddystone (UID and URL) beacons as well as 
flexibly control the transmit power of these beacons. I also develop firmware to improve asset tracking as well 
as work with tag vendors to better improve their advertisements in order to facilitate better asset visibility. 
I spend a lot of time optimizing message flow between the access points and the cloud. At Mist, I also work on the 
WiFi solution. Lately I've developed solutions for Wireless Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (WIPS/WIDS), for 
example, detecting and mitigating rogue access points, clients, as well as honeypots. Straddling the BLE and WiFi 
components on the AP I also leverage the information we receive to improve analytics.

Before Mist, I used to work at [Blue Clover Devices](https://www.bcdevices.com/) (BCD), an Internet of Things Device 
Manufacturer, in the Software Group. At BCD, I worked on building connected consumer electronics devices running 
Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and Apple HomeKit. My primary focus was on the firmware of these devices, but I also worked 
closely with the factory during production runs. I've worked on the [IHome iSS50](https://www.ihomeaudio.com/iSS50/), 
and implemented the device drivers for the temperature, light, humidity, and motion sensors on the product. I also 
spent a lot of time ensuring the data reported was properly calibrated and correctly reported via HomeKit and to the 
cloud via Evrythng. I also worked on an [open sourced BLE tool](https://github.com/gurpreetz/ble-tools) that facilitates 
testing and development of BLE based devices. I realized the need for this tool as I worked on the firmware for a 
[Desk Lamp](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/sensalite/id1053228450?mt=8). 

Prior to this, I worked at [Alcatel-Lucent](https://networks.nokia.com/) (since aquired by Nokia), in their IP Division. 
I was a member of the mobile group focussing on the 
[Evolved Packet Core](https://networks.nokia.com/products/7750-service-router/mobile-gateway) 
(EPC) Solution. As a part of this team, I worked on the Serving Gateway (SGW), PDN Gateway (PGW) and the GGSN. 
I have had the opportunity of designing and developing a GGSN to work in conjunction with our PGW, on the same 
platform, at the same time. On the GGSN I implemented support for UE initiated call flows, essentially, 
Creating, Updating, and Deleting PDP Contexts all of which trigger accounting records for the PDP Context. 
I have also added support for handovers, Inter and Intra SGSN, as well as a basic Inter-RAT handover.  I dealt 
with the control plane aspects of Lawful Interception on the LTE as well as UMTS based Mobile Gateways. 

Before I joined ALU, I worked at [Cisco](https://www.cisco.com/) in their Wireless Networking Business Unit. 
At Cisco, I focused on Mobility Services, and Location awareness technologies. My main tasks were developing 
tools to improve calibration of the network which in turn would lead to better accuracy in terms of wireless location. 
This is usually a cross product collaboration effort. 

I have also worked at [Tata Consultancy Services Ltd](https://www.tcs.com/), Bangalore, India, in their 
Wireless Communications Research lab. My primary areas of focus was on the link layer of wireless personal 
area networks (WPANs). I also worked on game theory and its applications on wireless mutiple access protocols.

During the summer of 2007, I interned at [Apple Inc](https://www.apple.com/) in their Exploratory Design group. 
At Apple, I worked on seamless network handovers based on the IEEE 802.21 standard.

On a lighter note, I enjoy writing, fencing, theater and [photography](http://www.flickr.com/photos/zoxcleb).

I have written a few short stories that still lie under my bed. My acting career took off in my school days 
where I studied under the banner of the Trinity College of Drama. I have a few professional plays under my belt.
