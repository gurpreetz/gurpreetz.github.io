### BLE Tools
##### Summer 2016
An open-source GoLang based tool to help with Bluetooth Low Energy device development. The tool can
  * Scan for all devices advertising in the area, and connect to them
  * Connect to specific devices and create an XML as well as human readable summary of services and characteristics supported by the BLE device
  * Compare BLE interface design with implementation to detect inconsistencies

Implementation can be found on [Github](https://github.com/gurpreetz/ble-tools).
