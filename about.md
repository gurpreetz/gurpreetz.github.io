I was born and raised in a quiet corner of the sprawling metropolis that is Mumbai (formerly Bombay), India. 

Since then I've travelled the world and lived in State College (PA), Humleb√¶k (Denmark), Trivandrum (India), 
Bengaluru (India), Pittsburgh (PA), and now finally, San Francisco (CA). 

For work I've focussed on wireless networks my entire career. I started with PANs (802.15.3 and 802.15.4), moved onto 
WLANs, and then over to cellular (3G and LTE). Not content with moving communicating over larger distances, I then 
looked towards the minute, focussing on BLE and its applications in IoT. Today, I use my skills in enterprise WiFi 
development and indoor locationing. 

When I'm not working, you can find me taking [pictures](https://www.instagram.com/gurpreetz/), [reading] (https://goodreads.com/gurpreetz), or fencing.
