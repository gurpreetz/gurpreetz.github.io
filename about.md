I was born and raised in a quiet corner of the sprawling metropolis that is Mumbai (formerly Bombay), India. 

Since then I've travelled the world and lived in State College (PA), Humleb√¶k (Denmark), Trivandrum (India), 
Bengaluru (India), Pittsburgh (PA), and now San Francisco (CA). 

For work I've focussed on wireless networks my entire career. I started with PANs ([802.15.3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.15#IEEE_802.15.3:_High_Rate_WPAN) and [802.15.4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.15#IEEE_802.15.4:_Low_Rate_WPAN)), moved onto 
WLANs ([802.11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11)), and then over to cellular ([3G](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3G) and [LTE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LTE_(telecommunication))). Not content with moving communicating over larger distances, I then 
looked towards the minute, focussing on [BLE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth_Low_Energy) and its applications in IoT. Today, I use my skills in enterprise WiFi 
development and indoor locationing. 

When I'm not working, you can find me taking [pictures](https://www.instagram.com/gurpreetz/),
[reading](https://goodreads.com/gurpreetz), fencing or travelling.
